# Tomcat_Upgrade

The files here are a sample of an automation script/procedure I wrote to deploy Apache Tomcat upgrades on multiple servers and environments in lieu of an automation engine (like Ansible).

Throughout, you will see portions of variables and comments changed to "SANITIZED". 
This is done to make any details of my previous company's environments as opaque as possible.
  
Writing this was a huge learning experience for me and I hope reading through it might help you learn something as well!
As is everything in my repository, this is free for use and modification.

That being said, if you run it as is in your (completely different from mine) environment, things will break and you will be sad.

Use your discretion. Bash accordingly!
